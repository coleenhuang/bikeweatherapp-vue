## Purpose
I've always found it really annoying when I'm ready to bike somewhere, but then I realize I've forgotten my bike light. The purpose of this app is to prevent things like this from happening. Once you enter your location, and the time that you intend to use your bike, the app informs you about the weather conditions and whether you should bring a bike light with you.

## Technologies Used
The app was built using Html, CSS, Javascript and Vue. 
The weather information was provided by the OpenWeather API and the Weatherbit API.
